# Report

Temperature control refers to procedures intended for maintenance
temperature in a given area at a certain high / low level or within a certain range.
This procedure is commonly used in many parts of the world. More recently, globalization once again
industrial development has created the need for Temperature Control applications in
various daily activities, especially with the advent of the green house effect




# ** SWOT Analysis: **

** Power: **

The advantage of such devices is that you can not wait until the whole salon is warm, and immediately continue the business. After all, heat has a local effect, so they do their job in 2-5 minutes.

** Weaknesses: **
- If you do not follow the recommendations and go too far with the temperature, this can lead to a decrease in the driver's attention, cause fatigue and headaches, and increase the risk of catching a fever due to a violation of body temperature regime. .
- the power cord is connected only after fixing the cape;
- if you spill any liquid on the heater cover, immediately turn off the device;
- when you leave the car, do not leave the device turned on;
- you can not wash capes, metal, high vibrations;
- Use dry bags to store the heater.

** Opportunities: **

Improved technology in car seat heaters is predicted to boost market growth during the review. Recent features such as modern chair heaters such as stable and controlled heating, temperature adjustment attract buyers and are expected to further market growth. Growing demand for luxury and energy in cars accelerates market growth.

** Threats: **
- Lack of rules for these seats has left consumers more vulnerable to injury.
- Within 10 minutes at 120 levels a person may have a third burn. For those who cannot feel the temperature right away, this can be even more dangerous. Those diagnosed with conditions such as disability, diabetes, and neuropathy do not want to feel heat in their lower extremities.
- High electrical resistance can cause the seat heater pad to overheat.

# ** 4W and 1H: **

** This: **
Hot seats can make cars more comfortable in winter, or for those who are often cold even in summer. Most car heaters work well, but the car seat heater is close to your body which allows you to warm up faster. In some cases, the seat is heated before the entire vehicle is heated.

** What: **
The heated front seats not only provide more comfort, relaxation and physical health benefits, but also increase safety. Heating chairs and backrests ensure a high level of comfort and prevent overcrowding. Winter clothing that restricts freedom of movement can be removed. This also results in better performance of the prevention system by reducing the instability of the safety belts. People with back or kidney problems benefit from a possible reduction in pain. It is widely used in cars.

** Where: **
In the car seats

** Why: **
Heating chairs can bring many different benefits in addition to having a comfortable, warm place to sit. One of the great benefits of hot seats is the heat treatment we offer. This is good for older drivers or people with less pain.

** How: **
If the seat cushion lasts too long, it gets too hot. If it lasted too long, it would be hot enough to be uncomfortable or dangerous to sit on. It may even ignite a fire in a pillow. To prevent this, most car seat heaters have a thermostat. The thermostat measures the temperature in the cushion. When it reaches a certain temperature, the thermostat sends a signal, automatically shutting off the relay until the seat cools slightly. At that point, the thermostat opens the relay again. Most seat cushions also have “upper” and “bottom” settings that allow the driver to control the temperature of the seat cushions.
